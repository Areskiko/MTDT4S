## Which abstractions does a modern OS provide?
- Multiprogramming
	- Only one instruction pointer
	- Context switching
- Concurrent Processes
	- Independent sequential control flows
- CPU Multiplexing
	- Only one process active at any time (single processer system)




## Process synchronization
- Critical sections
- Mutual exclusion
- Deadlocks

## Memory management
### Problems
- Minimize fragmentation
- Swap out memory segments
