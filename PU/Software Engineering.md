Differs from [[Computer Science | Computer Science/Engineering]] in that it concerns the practical production of software rather than the theoretical mathematics behind computers.

A big difference between software engineering and personal programming is the heavy use of [[Software Engineering Technique]]s which differ from case to case

A team should in advance make clear what [[Software Engineering Technique]]s they are using, and what the [[Development Process]] will be like.

As an engineer a software engineer has to take constraints, such as cost and time, into account and limit the scope of the product. Reuse of software may expedite the process, allowing the scope of the product to expand.
